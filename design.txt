conductor "object"/main event loop/whatever:
- owns console
- owns buffers
- knows what the current backend is
- can switch between buffers

buffers:
- contain text
- has current location of caret

backends:
- given input, decide what to do to current buffer
- identity backend:  char x -> x
- normal backend:  hjkl -> directions, dd -> delete line
